# OTLMOW Project 
This project aims to implement the Flemish data standard OTL (https://wegenenverkeer.data.vlaanderen.be/) in Python.

## Divided into smaller projects
Since the start of this project, this library has been split up into smaller partial projects, to reduce dependency problems and overhead.
This is the current list of projects that combine to the OTLMOW project:

+ otlmow-model: https://github.com/davidvlaminck/OTLMOW-Model
+ otlmow-modelbuilder: https://github.com/davidvlaminck/OTLMOW-ModelBuilder
+ otlmow-converter: https://github.com/davidvlaminck/OTLMOW-Converter
+ otlmow-template: https://github.com/davidvlaminck/OTLMOW-Template
+ otlmow-postenmapping: https://github.com/davidvlaminck/OTLMOW-PostenMapping
